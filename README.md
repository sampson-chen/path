path
====

path is the second iteration of [sack](https://github.com/sampson-chen/sack).

I had always meant to do a rewrite with something other than shellscripts, but
life kept me busy. Hopefully I'll find the time now.

TODOs:
- Describe what path should do in one sentence. Focus on building just that. It should do one thing and do it well.
- Feature list. Keep it small and relevant to core functionality. MVP.
- Design workflows and describe them as one would for a user-manual. If it's hard to describe, it's hard to use. Stay with "works-as-you-expect-it" conventions.
- Choose a language.
- Map out architecture.
- Build it.
- Get feedback, iterate.
